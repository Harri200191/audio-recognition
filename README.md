# Audio Recognition

In order to download the dataset for this model, visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harisrehmanhh/data-bed-cat-happy
The same implementation can also be found on kaggle at the link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/harisrehmanhh/audio-recognition-cnn

The neural network trains on a dataset and converts speech to text for 3 words: cat, happy, and bed. This can easily be extended for multiple casses but due to limited data, that was not possible. For that purpose, it is best to use a good speech recognition API in your program. The purpose of this implementation was practing and playing around with concepts.
